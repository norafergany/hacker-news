## Technologies Used
* styled Bootstrap
* Jest
* React-Testing-Library
* Axios
* styled-components
* react-error-boundary

### Motivations
I used React-Testing-Library to quickly spin-up a responsive user experience. In an application with high-traffic that scales, it might be better to use pure CSS solutions so that JS doesn't have to compile CSS. I used axios for more reliable error handling

## Assumptions/Acknowledgements
In handling errors, I logged errors to the console. In production those would be replaced with logs sent to an error service
